Package for asynchronous saving of users favorite numbers to the redis
Users can connect via websocket protocol and save favorite number
Command for saving favorite number is "user name:number"
    example: "Crazy Camel:42"
There is also a special command "LIST" which lists all users alphabetically
    along with their favorite numbers
Also, after any user successfully saves a favorite number,
    favorite numbers of all users (like in "LIST" command)
    will be broadcasted to all active websocket connections

Since this is more of a exploratory code sample, it is not production ready.
Write order is not guaranteed.
    Theoretically one user can save 2 different numbers in quick succession.
    Those writes are pushed to queue and there is no guarantees that processing
    of tasks put in queue will finish in order they were placed.

Applications should be fairly scalable with some slight modifications.
Main bottleneck would redis "list" queue.
In theory, redis PUB/SUB can also be limitation.
Worker should scale without problems as it is.
Server would have to handle address:port binding.
    Also, websocket initialization would have to be load balanced.
    Once a connection is active, better to leave it on instance it lands on.

Reading of user's favorite numbers might be a problem as it is.
    Currently done via single redis MGET cmd.
    Yep, using redis for storage like this is not the best choice.
